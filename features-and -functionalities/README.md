# Features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend
Core Functionalities

The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.

# User Management
User Registration: Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts. Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

User Login and Authentication: Implement login via email and password. Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).

Profile Management: Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.

# Property Listings Management
Add Listings: Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability. 

Edit/Delete Listings: Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

# Search and Filtering
Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by: Location Price range Number of guests Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly) Include pagination for large datasets.

# Booking Management
Booking Creation: Guests can book a property for specified dates. Prevent double bookings using date validation.

Booking Cancellation: Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.

Booking Status: Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

# Payment Integration
Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle: Upfront payments by guests. Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed. Include support for multiple currencies.

# Reviews and Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. Hosts can respond to reviews. Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.

# Notifications System
Implement email and in-app notifications for: Booking confirmations Cancellations Payment updates

# Admin Dashboard
Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing: Users Listings Bookings Payments

# Technical Requirements
Database Management
Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. Required tables: Users (guests and hosts) Properties Bookings Reviews Payments

# API Development
Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend. Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for: GET (retrieve data) POST (create data) PUT/PATCH (update data) DELETE (remove data) Use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

# Authentication and Authorization
Use JWT for secure user sessions. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between: Guests Hosts Admins

# File Storage (Scenario based)
Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary. For implementation, we will use file storage

# Third-Party Services
Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

# Error Handling and Logging
Implement global error handling for APIs.

# Non-Functional Requirements
## Scalability
Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases. Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.

## Security
Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption. Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

## Performance Optimization
Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results). Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

## Testing
Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest . Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
